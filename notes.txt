Pipes are used for output.. sync and async data

Eg: transforming into
uppercase, lowercase, capital


we can format text w/o changing property values format

For multiple parameters in pipes it is separated by colons.

datepipe, uppercasepipe, slicepipe

Refer API section for more details

Order of pipes is necessary. It parses from left to right



Add shortenpipe in declarations in app modules just like components & directives

To generate pipes
ng generate pipe <name>
ng g p <name>


To update array or obj doesn't trigger it


Angular doesn't rerender pipe with data as it is pure when value is changed

Pipe is recalculated by adding pure false. 
It recalculates on pipe args changes or anything on page changes to avoid performance issues


async pipe recognizes that this is a promise & as a side note it will also work with observables. there it would subscribe automatically
& after 2 secs it would simply recognize  that something changed/promise resolved/in case of observables, data was sent thru the subscription
 & it will print this data to the screen
